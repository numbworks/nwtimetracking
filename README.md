## Introduction

From the documentation:

> nwtimetracking is a Jupyter Notebook designed to analyze the Excel file I use to annotate the durations of all my sessions of extra work and continuos learning, so that I can run analyses on them. This software is born to overcome the lack of support for durations (timedeltas) in Excel.
