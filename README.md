## In short

From the documentation:

> nwtimetracking is a Jupyter Notebook designed to analyze the Excel file I use to annotate the durations of all my sessions of extra work and continuos learning, so that I can run analyses on them. This software is born to overcome the lack of support for durations (timedeltas) in Excel.

## Download the source code

I assume you are on `Windows`, but the software should run without issues on `Linux` as well. Please:

1. Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win);
2. Open `Windows Powershell` (or `Windows Terminal` or similar) and type:

```powershell
PS C:\> mkdir nwtimetracking
PS C:\> cd .\nwtimetracking\
PS C:\nwreadinglistmanager> git clone https://github.com/numbworks/nwtimetracking.git
```

3. Open `src/nwtimetracking.ipynb` with `Visual Studio Code` or other `Jupyter Notebook`-enabled environment;
4. Done!
