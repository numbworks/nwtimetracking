## Introduction

From the documentation:

> `nwtimetracking` is an application designed to run automated data analysis tasks on `Time Tracking.xlsx`. This file is the one I use to annotate the durations of all my sessions of extra work and continuos learning. This application is born to overcome the lack of support for durations (timedeltas) in Excel.
